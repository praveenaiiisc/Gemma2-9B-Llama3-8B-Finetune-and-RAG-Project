This involves computing the gradient of the output with respect to the input, and then propagating the error backwards through the network.\\n5. **Gradient Update**: The algorithm updates the model's parameters using the computed gradient.\\n\\nThe back-propagation algorithm is typically used in conjunction with an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent, to minimize the loss function and train the model.\\n\\nIn the given context, the back-propagation algorithm is applied to the unrolled graph associated with a fully-connected multi-layer MLP.
